# Docker Guide

This is a guide on Docker technology. The intent of the guide is to serve as a starting point for those not familiar with Docker. However it is also meant for experienced individuals that may be looking for alternative ways of looking at Docker.

> NOTE: This is a "living" guide and will continuously evolve over time as I distill more of my knowledge of Docker.
